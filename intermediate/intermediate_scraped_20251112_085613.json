It\u2019s collective.\n\nITLX is building a system where you can team up with others to earn real rewards in $USDC.\nEvery verified action from you and your network adds up, turning collaboration into measurable milestones.\n\nThis allows you to build your own model similar to a Broker Company in the crypto world, with almost zero cost and a stable monthly revenue stream generated through your team\u2019s performance.\n\nWhether you\u2019re just starting your journey or leading a growing squad, every move matters.\nEach transaction pushes your team closer to the next Tier, and each Tier means real, on-chain rewards waiting to be unlocked.\n\n Tier Milestones \ud83d\udc47\n\ud83c\udfc6 Tier 1  $8 910 / Month\n\ud83c\udf10 Tier 2  $2 295 / Month\n\ud83d\udd25 Tier 3  $630 / Month\n\u26a1\ufe0f Tier 4  $210 / Month\n\ud83d\udc8e Tier 5  $70 / Month\n\ud83e\ude99 Tier 6  $35 / Month\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Note:\nWhen you reach a higher Tier, you can also receive the rewards from all lower Tiers, maximizing your total monthly earnings.\n\nHow your Tier is calculated:\nYour own trading volume + your direct team\u2019s volume (F1) + 20% of your indirect team\u2019s volume (F2).\n\nTogether, these layers form the ITLX ecosystem that rewards real people for real participation.\nNo bots. No speculation. Just verified network power, tracked transparently on-chain.\n\n\u2699\ufe0f This isn\u2019t just trading.\nIt\u2019s about building a sustainable business model with your team, where long-term success is shared and powered by collective growth.\n\n#ITLX #ITLG #ITL",
